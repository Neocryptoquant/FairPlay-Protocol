## ü§î What is FairPlay?

FairPlay Protocol is built to:
- **Launch campaigns**: Organizers can create campaigns with a reward pool (in USDC) and set deadlines.
- **Track contributions**: Automatically monitor GitHub Pull Requests (PRs) and evaluate their impact.
- **Distribute rewards**: Allocate rewards transparently based on a scoring model.

## üöÄ How to Interact with FairPlay

### For Organizers:
1. **Create a Campaign**: Use the frontend to set up a campaign, define the reward pool, and specify the GitHub repository to track.
2. **Fund the Campaign**: Deposit USDC into the campaign's escrow account.
3. **Monitor Contributions**: Let the backend handle GitHub PR tracking and scoring.
4. **Close the Campaign**: Once the deadline passes, finalize the campaign to calculate rewards.

### For Contributors:
1. **Connect Your Wallet**: Link your Solana wallet to the campaign via the frontend.
2. **Contribute**: Submit meaningful PRs to the specified GitHub repository.
3. **Track Your Score**: View your contribution score and potential rewards in real-time.
4. **Claim Rewards**: After the campaign ends, withdraw your share of the reward pool.

## üßÆ How Rewards Are Calculated

FairPlay uses a transparent scoring model:

| Contribution Type         | Description                        | Score |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|-------|
| ‚úÖ **Merged PR**          | Successfully merged into the repo | 100   |
| üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Reviewed PR**     | Not merged but reviewed/discussed | 20    |
| üö´ **Spam/Invalid PR**    | Irrelevant or spammy              | 0     |

Rewards are distributed proportionally:

```
reward_i = (score_i / total_scores) * total_reward
```
